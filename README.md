# tarballjs
Javascript library to create or read tar files in the browser (under-development)

## Why?
It is often necessary to pack data into single files in the browser (e.g. creating a "project" file consisting of images+data in WebPlotDigitizer). One way is to create simple tarballs with all the data. There are a few existing libraries that do this, but they don't seem very well maintained.

## Status
This library is just an intial hack at the moment. If you are looking for more serious attempts, then please refer to the following:

- https://github.com/beatgammit/tar-js
- https://github.com/InvokIT/js-untar (reading only)
- http://stuk.github.io/jszip/ (active and well maintained project but for .zip files)

If you are aware of other implementations, then please let me know :)
